IMPORTANT NOTE:
Its important to note that while my program does utilize a scanner,
it only uses the scanner to read each LINE of the text file, which it then saves in a string called text.
I wrote my own .next() and .hasNext() method for reading lexemes in each line.

Basic Description:
My program reads the text file into a scanner, which then reads each line into a string,
which then calls its own .nextLine() and saves it into a String lexeme to be passed to .position() .value() and .kind()
to be analyzed.

Known issues:
A deep looping issue is causing my code to read words/ lexemes in a peculiar way that can be annoying.
At its worst, it simply causes my code to sometimes reread lexemes.
This issue (for reasons far beyond my ability to understand) causes my .next() to repeat, or chop up words rarely and randomly.
Testing, by replacing my .next() method with the scanner's .next() confirms that the issue is with my code.
But after rewriting my .next() methods like 10 times, I really am not sure how my issue is possible.

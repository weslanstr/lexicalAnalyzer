IMPORTANT NOTE:
Its important to note that while my program does utilize a scanner,
it only uses the scanner to read each LINE of the text file, which it then saves in a string called text.
I wrote my own .next() and .hasNext() method for reading lexemes in each line.

Basic Description:
My program reads the text file into a scanner, which then reads each line into a string,
which then calls its own .nextLine() and saves it into a String lexeme to be passed to .position() .value() and .kind()
to be analyzed.

Known issues:
A deep looping issue is causing my code to read lexemes improperly.
The issue is extremely strange, and I spent the last few days trying and failing to identify the pattern.
Despite my best efforts, I was not able to resolve it in time.
